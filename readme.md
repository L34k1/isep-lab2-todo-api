#I copiously used genAI as a crutch to compensate for my lack of relevant skills.

I at least now understand better :

- How APIs work.
- How good architecture renders understanding easier (and why it's essential).

Also, I now understand clean code as a code visualization that approaches it to graph theory.
Each folder in the repository is a subnode, and it allows for a mental mapping of interactions between different pieces of code.

Thank you for this lab.
